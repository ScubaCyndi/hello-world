How to Become a Githubster

Fellow Earth-Dwellers...

I want to live my best life!  I'm a wife, a mom to boys, a lover of the written word, a diver, a fast driver, a practitioner of "The Golden Rule", a sister to amazing siblings, a loyal friend and a super hard worker.

How can I use all of these qualities to become a contributing member of the Github team?

PS - this tutorial is very cool!!
