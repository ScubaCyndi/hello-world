How to Become a Githubster

Fellow Earth-Dwellers...

I want to live my best life!  I'm a wife, a mom to boys, a lover of the written word, a diver, a fast driver, a practitioner of "The Golden Rule", a sister to amazing siblings, a loyal friend and a super hard worker.

I know I could use all of these qualities to become a contributing member of the Github team!

PS - this tutorial is very cool!!

Who can I give CREDIT to for creating something this awesome?  I would like to Collaborate with them so that I can help deliver awesome Results too!  I would like to demonstrate how I also prize Efficiency and Diversity.  I could definitely learn how to be much better at Iteration, but I 100% believe in Transparency and am willing to soak up new things like a wet sponge!

Can we talk for real?
